# jproxy

one quite simple java proxy project.

I try to build a little proxy with Jetty and Servlet, so I can visit earth nullschool real-time epak data in localhost mode.

## How to use
1 Import this project with Eclipse and fix the correct path of jars


2 Run this application


3 Visit http://localhost:8080/wind/index.html through your Browser

## Note


As a naive Java beginner, this is only a Java Project for me to practice, so do not expect too much and pls encourage me, thanks~
